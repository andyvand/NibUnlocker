Because much of the layout of an app does not need to change for any available screen size, there is an additional value, <em>any</em>.</p><p>The current size class for a view controller is based on three factors:</p><ul><li><p>The screen size of the device.</p></li><li><p>The orientation of the device.</p></li><li><p>The portion of the screen available to the view controller. For example, when a split view controller displays both the master and detail controllers, neither controller has access to the full screen.</p></li></ul><p>Interface Builder lets you customize the layout, constraints, and properties of objects based on the size class. The layout then automatically adapts as the size class changesâ€”for example, when the user switches from portrait to landscape, or opens a split view on an iPad.</p></body></html>

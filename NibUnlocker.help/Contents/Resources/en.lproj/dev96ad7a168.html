Although file lists are provided at build time, they allow you to maintain the inputs and outputs of shell scripts outside of the project file.</p><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>If you use build settings in the file paths, they will be replaced with the build setting values of the target that is using the file list.</p></div></body></html>

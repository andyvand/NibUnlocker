After adding a cross-project reference, you can refer to the other project’s targets, files, and products using the “target dependencies,” “copy files,” and “link binary with libraries” build phases. If the other project can’t be located at build time, the build system still attempts to build but produces missing dependency warnings.</p></body></html>

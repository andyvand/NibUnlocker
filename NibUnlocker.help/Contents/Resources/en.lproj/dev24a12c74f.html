They consist only of certain types of data: dictionaries, arrays, strings, numbers (integer and float), dates, binary data, and Boolean values. Property lists give apps a lightweight and portable way to store small amounts of data.</p><p>Property lists in Xcode projects are contained in files with the <code>.plist</code> extension.</p><p>Click a property list in the Project navigator and the <em>property list editor</em> appears in the source editor pane, allowing you to inspect or edit its contents.</p></body></html>

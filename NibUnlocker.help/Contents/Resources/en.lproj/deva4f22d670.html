This feature has been deprecated since Xcode 8.3 and is not supported by the New Build System. If your project depends on this feature, you may need to modify your build settings or source files to stop using it.</p><div id="dev3b1dafcdc" class="Task"><h2 role="button" aria-controls="aria-dev3b1dafcdc" aria-expanded="true" class="Name">If the build warns that "Traditional headermap style is no longer supported”</h2><div class="TaskBody" role="region" aria-hidden="false" id="aria-dev3b1dafcdc"><p>When you build a target which has the "Always Search User Paths" build setting enabled, you will see a warning similar to:</p><div class="CodeLines"><code class="CodeLine">warning: Traditional headermap style is no longer supported; please migrate to using separate headermaps and set 'ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS' to NO.</code></div><ul class="ListSingle"><li><p>To eliminate this warning, set the <code>ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS</code> build setting to <code>NO</code> as instructed. </p><p>This will disable the warning.

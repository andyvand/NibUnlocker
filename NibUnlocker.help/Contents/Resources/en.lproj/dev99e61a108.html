In some cases, Xcode can discover these dependencies and build the targets in the appropriate order. For example, when an app target links to a library target, Xcode can infer that the library target must be built first. Such a relationship is an <em>implicit dependency</em>. You can also define an <em>explicit dependency</em> on another target in the target dependencies build phase of a target. In this case, you specify the order in which the other target is built.</p><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>The Find Implicit Dependencies checkbox must be selected in the Build pane of the scheme editor for Xcode to infer target dependencies.</p></div></body></html>

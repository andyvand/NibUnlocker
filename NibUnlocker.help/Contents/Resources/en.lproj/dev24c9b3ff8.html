In a continuous integration workflow, you write apps locally in Xcode on your development Mac and check them into a source code repository. You then send them to Xcode Server for processing.</p><p>In Xcode on your development Mac, you set up <em>bots</em> that run on the server. These bots process your apps, using the source code in your repository, and report back the results. Each run of a bot is called an <em>integration</em>, and these runs occur regularly throughout the development life cycle of your app.</p><p>Xcode Server can be run on any Mac running Xcode, including your development Mac.</p></body></html>

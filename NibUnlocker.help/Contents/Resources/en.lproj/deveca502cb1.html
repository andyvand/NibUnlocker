You configure the App ID indirectly through Xcode to use certain app services. Xcode enables and configures app services by setting entitlements and performing other configuration steps. Some entitlements are enabled for an App ID (stored in your developer account) and others are set in the Xcode project. When you export or upload your app, Xcode signs the app bundle with the distribution certificate referenced in the distribution provisioning profile.</p></body></html>

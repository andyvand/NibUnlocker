In App Store Connect, you can <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devcdda55918" class="URL">select territories</a> where your app will be available on the App Store, as well as <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deve6f78a8e2" class="URL">localize the App Store information</a>. Then you localize your app in Xcode so those users experience your app in their own native language, region, and culture.</p><p>To prepare your app for localization, first <a href="devafa3a605f.html#devafa3a605f" class="xRef AppleTopic">add the languages</a> you want to support to your project. Then <a href="dev7c584bb2a.html#dev7c584bb2a" class="xRef AppleTopic">mark the resources</a> you want to vary for the languages as localizable. You can localize resources—such as user interface files, images, and audio files—for all or specific languages.</p><p>Then <a href="deve7c832cd2.html#deve7c832cd2" class="xRef AppleTopic">export localizations</a> for the languages you are ready to support and give the language-specific <a href="dev5a03f5aa1.html#dev5a03f5aa1" class="xRef AppleTopic">Xcode Localization Catalog (xcloc)</a> folders to localizers. Optionally, add files to the xcloc folder to provide context for localizers. </p><p>You can continue developing your app in the base language and, optionally, <a href="devf66469903.html#devf66469903" class="xRef AppleTopic">lock views</a> while waiting for localization. Then you <a href="devda5206e6c.html#devda5206e6c" class="xRef AppleTopic">import localizations</a>, the translated xcloc folders.</p><p>Thoroughly test your app in each language you support. Before you export localizations for translations, you can <a href="dev499a9529e.html#dev499a9529e" class="xRef AppleTopic">test localizations</a> using pseudolanguages. After you import localizations, you can test your app in the languages and regions you added.</p></body></html>

For example, when an app target links to a library target, Xcode can infer that the library target must be built first. This behavior is governed by the Find Implicit Dependencies checkbox—which is enabled by default—in the Build pane of the scheme editor.</p><p>When this option is enabled, at build time, Xcode automatically scans all of the targets declared in the scheme to determine whether any dependencies exist. A dependency exists if any of the following scenarios are detected:</p><ul><li><p>A target includes a “Link binary with libraries” build phase that requires a product of another target.</p></li><li><p>A target includes a “Copy files” build phase that requires a file produced by another target.</p></li></ul><p>Xcode then builds the targets in the appropriate order.</p></body></html>

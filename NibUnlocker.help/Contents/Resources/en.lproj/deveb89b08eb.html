For convenience, the team provisioning profile contains all registered devices and all development certificates, so that any member of your team can run all apps on all devices. Otherwise, you can also create custom development provisioning profiles (containing a subset of devices and development certificates) in your developer account.</p><p>Xcode creates App IDs and team provisioning profiles as needed depending on the configuration and capabilities of your app. Xcode updates the team provisioning profile whenever you register a device, create a development certificate, or modify the App ID within Xcode. (Changes you make in your developer account don’t automatically update team provisioning profiles.)</p><p>If your app can use a wildcard App ID during development, Xcode creates a team provisioning profile containing a wildcard App ID that it also creates. The team provisioning profile name is <code>[platform] Team Provisioning Profile: [App ID]</code> where <code>platform</code> is iOS, Mac, or tvOS, and an asterisk (<em>*</em>) indicates a wildcard App ID. For example, the profile name for an iOS app is <em>iOS Team Provisioning Profile:*</em>. </p><p>You can use a wildcard App ID only with a subset of app services. If you add a capability that requires an explicit App ID—for example, iCloud, Game Center, or In-App Purchase—Xcode creates an explicit App ID and a corresponding team provisioning profile. For example, if the bundle ID for an iOS app is <code>com.example.ajohnson.HelloWorld</code>, the corresponding team provisioning profiles name is <code>iOS Team Provisioning Profile: com.example.ajohnson.HelloWorld</code>. Because an explicit App ID exactly matches the project’s bundle ID, you can register only one explicit App ID per bundle ID. Therefore, if one already exists in your developer account, Xcode uses it in the team provisioning profile instead of creating one for you.</p><p>This diagram shows an iOS Team Provisioning Profile using a wildcard App ID for an organization with three developers.</p><p>This diagram shows a Mac Team Provisioning Profile using an explicit App ID for an organization developing a macOS app.</p></body></html>

For example, if you are editing the Objective-C source file <em>MyClass.m</em> in the standard editor, the Assistant automatically shows the header file <em>MyClass.h</em> for the class. You can show this editor, split it into multiple panes, and configure its behavior using the View &gt; Assistant Editor menu.</p></body></html>

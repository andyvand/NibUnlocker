It is a two-part string used to identify one or more apps from a single development team. There are two types of App IDs: an explicit App ID, used for a single app, and a wildcard App ID, used for a set of apps.</p><p>An <em>explicit App ID</em> contains the full path of a bundle ID and exactly matches a single app. The string consists of a Team ID and a bundle ID search string, with a period (.) separating the two parts. The Team ID is supplied by Apple and is unique to a specific development team, while the bundle ID search string is supplied by you to match either the bundle ID of a single app or a set of bundle IDs for a group of your apps.</p><p>A <em>wildcard App ID</em> contains an asterisk as the last part of its bundle ID search string. The asterisk replaces some or all of the bundle ID in the search string.</p><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>To use certain services and submit to the App Store, you may be required to use an explicit App ID.</p></div></body></html>

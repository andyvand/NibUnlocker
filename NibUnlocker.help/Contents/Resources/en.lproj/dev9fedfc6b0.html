Any issues are marked with a red underline or a caret at the position of the error. An error icon also appears in the gutter. Clicking the icon in the gutter displays a message describing the possible error and, in many cases, offers to repair it automatically.</p><div class="Alert"><p class="Important"><strong>Important: </strong>To use Fix-it, you must build the target with the LLVM or Swift compiler and the indexing of your project must be complete. Fix-it works with Swift, C, Objective-C, and Objective-C++.</p></div></body></html>

To edit the user interface, select a <a href="dev8169bdeae.html#dev8169bdeae" class="xRef Aside">user interface file</a> in the <a href="dev7d7220fbb.html#dev7d7220fbb" class="xRef Aside">Project navigator</a> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/IDEStructureNavigatorTemplate.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">), </span>and the file opens in Interface Builder in the <a href="dev8d94680a3.html#dev8d94680a3" class="xRef Aside">editor area</a>. All projects created from a template contain a <code>Main.storyboard</code> file that contains the user interface for your app. For watchOS apps, the file is called <code>Interface.storyboard</code>. For iOS apps, there’s also a <code>LaunchScreen.storyboard</code> file for the view that is displayed while the app is launching. A storyboard (<code>.storyboard</code>) file contains a set of view controllers and their views. To open Interface Builder in a separate window, Control-click the user interface file in the Project navigator, then choose Open in New Window from the pop-up menu.</p><figure><img src="Art/IB_overview.png" alt="" height="358" width="601"></figure><p>The canvas shows your user interface as it appears on a device. The first time you open a storyboard file, the layout appears in a default device configuration that you can change later using the “View as” controls below the canvas.</p><p>The library contains resources that you can add to your project or files. To add an object to the user interface, click the <a href="dev82225f789.html#dev82225f789" class="xRef Aside">Object library</a> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/LB_Objects.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>button in the <a href="devf0d1df47a.html#devf0d1df47a" class="xRef Aside">toolbar</a>, then drag the resource from the library to the canvas. To view the objects in a list or a grid, toggle the icon in the upper-right corner of the library (the list view shows descriptions of the resources). To filter the objects, enter text in the filter bar at the top of the library. For example, to find a button, enter <code>button</code> in the filter bar.</p><p>Drag all of the objects you want in your user interface to the canvas. Reposition the objects by dragging them to where you want, using the gridlines to help align and center the objects. To change text (for example, to edit the title of a button), double-click the object, then enter the text.</p><p>Similarly, use the Media library to add system audio and image files to objects. To open the Media library, click and hold the Object library button in the toolbar, then choose Show Media Library from the pop-up menu.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_library.png" alt="" height="281" width="600"></figure><p>In the inspector area (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/XC_O_utilities_button.png" alt="" height="10" width="13">), </span>the File inspector (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/UB_File.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>and Quick Help inspector (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/UB_QuickHelp.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>are available throughout your project and display information depending on what you select in the navigator and editor areas. The other inspectors are specific to what you select on the canvas. To edit the attributes of an object, select the object on the canvas and click the <a href="devc95b85b58.html#devc95b85b58" class="xRef Aside">Attributes inspector</a> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/UB_IBAttributes.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">). </span>To get information about the size and position of a view, click the Size inspector (<img src="Art/UB_Size.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">).</p><p>To view the user interface on different device types, click the “View as” button below the canvas and select a device. To further configure the device, select an orientation, adaptation (iPad devices), or interface style (Apple TV devices). For macOS apps, select an appearance.</p><figure><img src="Art/AUI_device_pane_iOS.png" alt="" height="78" width="486"></figure><p>If the objects in the canvas don’t appear in the location you expect, use Auto Layout constraints to set rules for how the objects should scale and reposition. To center an object in a view, select the object and in the lower-right corner of the canvas, click the align icon (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/ib_icon_Align.png" alt="" height="13" width="17">). </span>To place the object in the center of the view, select Horizontally in Container and Vertically in Container, and click Add 2 Constraints in the align tool popover.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_ib_align_tool.png" alt="" height="388" width="600"></figure><p>Similarly, set the position of other objects, and optionally, set the position relative to an adjacent object. To pin the bottom of a label to the top of a button, select the label and click the Add New Constraints icon (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/ib_icon_Add_New_Constraints.png" alt="" height="13" width="17">). </span>In the add new constraints tool popover, select the dashed red line below the box, enter the distance below, and click Add 1 Constraint. Continue adding constraints until no more Auto Layout warnings appear in the activity view in the toolbar. To check the constraints, change the device configuration below the canvas or run the app in Simulator again.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_ib_pin_tool.png" alt="" height="408" width="598"></figure><p>The <em>outline view</em> provides a hierarchical view of your objects in the user interface file. If the outline view is collapsed, click the toggle (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/XC_O_area_button_navigator.png" alt="" height="10" width="13">) </span>below the canvas to expand it. You should be able to see the objects you added to the canvas under View Controller Scene. The outline view also shows Auto Layout and localization issues. Click the red arrow to see the details of what went wrong, and then click an issue to highlight the associated view. Alternatively, click the warnings in the activity view in the toolbar.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_autolayout_error.png" alt="" height="286" width="600"></figure><p>Every scene in a storyboard references a view controller class that contains the code that manipulates the view. If you have multiple scenes in the storyboard, first select the scene in the outline view, then click the Identity inspector (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/UB_IBIdentity.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>to get the associated view controller class. The class name appears under Custom Class in the inspector. To open the source file, click the arrow that appears in the Class text field.</p><p>To connect objects on the canvas to your code, open the <a href="devb6a5be431.html#devb6a5be431" class="xRef Aside">assistant editor</a>. If necessary, open the implementation file for the view controller in the assistant editor. In the jump bar at the top of the assistant editor, choose Automatic followed by the class implementation filename—for example, <code>ViewController.swift</code>.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_connection_drag.png" alt="" height="351" width="600"></figure><p>Add an outlet if you want to reference an interface object in your code—for example, change its value at runtime. To create an outlet, Control-drag from the object on the canvas to the code in the assistant editor where property declarations are allowed. In the popover that appears, enter the property name and click Connect. </p><figure><img src="Art/gs_connection_choose.png" alt="" height="193" width="356"></figure><p>To add an action method that’s called when the user interacts with a control (for example, taps a button, enters text, or moves a slider), Control-drag from the control to the method implementation section of the implementation file. In the popover that appears, choose Action from the Connection pop-up menu, enter the method name, and click Connect (optionally, specify the types and the event that invokes the action). You can enter the code for the action method now, or enter it later using the source editor. To highlight the object in the canvas for a connection, hover the pointer over the dot in the gutter of the assistant editor.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_connection_made.png" alt="" height="311" width="508"></figure><p>To view and edit the connections for an object, select the object and open the <a href="devefa5f2294.html#devefa5f2294" class="xRef Aside">Connections inspector</a> (<img src="Art/UB_IBConnections.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">).</p><p>In the assistant editor, you can view a live preview of the user interface as you create it. From the assistant editor jump bar, choose a user interface file from the Preview menu. For example, choose <code>Main.storyboard (Preview)</code>, and the assistant editor shows the layout of the first view your users see. For iOS apps, use the control at the bottom of the preview to switch between portrait and landscape modes. If you add localization to your app, you can select a language from the pop-up menu in the lower-right corner. If you don’t have localization yet but want to see how your layout handles different string lengths, choose Double-Length Pseudolanguage from the language menu. To preview multiple device configurations, click the Add button (+) under the assistant editor, then choose another device. For macOS apps, add previews for both Dark Appearance and Light Appearance (go to <a href="devcdad283cc.html#devcdad283cc" class="xRef AppleTopic">Support dark mode (macOS)</a>).</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_preview.png" alt="" height="337" width="600"></figure><p>For macOS apps, add items to the Touch Bar. Drag an <code>NSTouchBar</code> object from the Object library to a window or custom view. Then drag <code>NSTouchBarItem</code> objects to the Touch Bar and connect the items to your code. Test the items using a real Touch Bar on a Mac or if you don’t have one, using the <a href="dev63bb08928.html#dev63bb08928" class="xRef Aside">Touch Bar simulator</a>. To open the simulator, choose Window &gt; Show Touch Bar.</p><figure><img src="Art/IB_Touch_Bar_add.png" alt="" height="352" width="600"></figure><div class="ListDescriptor"><p><strong class="Term">Next Step: </strong><a href="devc4ecaf4e9.html#devc4ecaf4e9" class="xRef AppleTopic">Write your code</a>.</p></div><div class="LinkUniversal"><strong>See also</strong><a href="dev31645f17f.html#dev31645f17f" class="xRef AppleTopic">Interface Builder workflow</a><a href="devc5759ad6f.html#devc5759ad6f" class="xRef AppleTopic">About Auto Layout and Layout Constraints</a><a href="dev7a8cb8a8c.html#dev7a8cb8a8c" class="xRef AppleTopic">Show and hide the Touch Bar simulator</a><a href="dev5274a91d6.html#dev5274a91d6" class="xRef AppleTopic">Preview the items in your NSTouchBar object</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nstouchbar" class="URL">NSTouchBar reference</a></div></body></html>

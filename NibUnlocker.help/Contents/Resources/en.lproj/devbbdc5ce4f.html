(iOS, tvOS, watchOS)</h1><p>The App Store and operating system optimize the installation of iOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps by tailoring app delivery to the capabilities of the user’s particular device and operating system, with minimal footprint. This optimization, called <em>app thinning</em>, lets you create apps that use the most device features, occupy minimum disk space, and accommodate future updates that can be applied by Apple. Faster downloads and more space for other apps and content provides a better user experience.</p><div id="dev5cfb72486" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Slicing (iOS, tvOS)</h2><p><em>Slicing</em> is the process of creating and delivering variants of the app bundle for different target devices and operating systems. A <em>variant</em> contains only the executable architecture and resources that are needed for the target device. You continue to develop and upload full versions of your app to App Store Connect. The App Store will create and deliver different variants based on the devices your app supports. Use asset catalogs so that the App Store can select images, GPU resources, and other data appropriate for each device variant. When the user installs an app, a variant for the user’s device is downloaded and installed.</p><p>Xcode simulates slicing during development so you can create and test variants locally. Xcode slices your app when you build and run your app on a device or in Simulator. When you create an archive, Xcode includes the full version of your app but allows you to export variants from the archive.</p><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>Sliced apps are supported on devices running  iOS and tvOS 9.0 and later. Otherwise, the App Store delivers <a href="deve329cde32.html#deve329cde32" class="xRef Aside">universal variants</a> to customers. Universal variants are also delivered to Apple Developer Enterprise Program users and to users installing apps via iTunes 12.6.5 or earlier.</p></div></div><div id="deve2738d396" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Bitcode</h2><p><em>Bitcode</em> is an intermediate representation of a compiled program. Apps you upload to App Store Connect that contain bitcode will be compiled and linked on the App Store. Including bitcode will allow Apple to re-optimize your <a href="dev7af8b1d18.html#dev7af8b1d18" class="xRef Aside">app binary</a> in the future without the need to submit a new version of your app to the App Store. </p><p>For iOS apps, bitcode is the default, but optional. For watchOS and tvOS apps, bitcode is required. If you provide bitcode, all apps and frameworks in the app bundle (all targets in the project) need to include bitcode. </p><p>Xcode hides your app’s symbols by default, so they are not readable by Apple. When you <a href="dev442d7f2ca.html#dev442d7f2ca" class="xRef AppleTopic">upload your app to App Store Connect</a>, you have the option of including symbols. Including symbols allows Apple to <a href="dev861f46ea8.html#dev861f46ea8" class="xRef AppleTopic">provide crash reports for your app</a> when you <a href="dev2539d985f.html#dev2539d985f" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute your app using TestFlight</a> or <a href="dev067853c94.html#dev067853c94" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute your app through the App Store</a>. If you’d like to collect and <a href="devd9e1c13be.html#devd9e1c13be" class="xRef Aside">symbolication</a> crash reports yourself, you don’t have to upload symbols. Instead, you can <a href="devef5928039.html#devef5928039" class="xRef AppleTopic">download the bitcode compilation dSYM files</a> after you distribute your app.</p></div><div id="deva4d6cffce" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">On-Demand Resources (iOS, tvOS)</h2><p><em>On-demand resources</em> are resources—such as images and sounds—that you can tag with keywords and request in groups, by tag. The App Store hosts the resources on Apple servers and manages the downloads for you. The App Store also slices on-demand resources, further optimizing variants of the app. </p><p>On-demand resources provide a better user experience:</p><ul><li><p>App sizes are smaller so apps download faster, improving the first-time launch experience. </p></li><li><p>On-demand resources download in the background, as needed, while the user explores your app.</p></li><li><p>The operating system purges on-demand resources when they are no longer needed and disk space is low.</p></li></ul><p>For example, a master-detail app may divide resources into levels and request the next level of resources only when the app anticipates that the user will move to that level. Similarly, the app can request In-App Purchase resources only when the user makes the corresponding in-app purchase. </p><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>If you <a href="dev7ccaf4d3c.html#dev7ccaf4d3c" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute your app to registered devices</a> (outside of the App Store), you must host the on-demand resources yourself.</p></div><p>To set up on-demand resources in your app, read <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015083" class="URL">On-Demand Resources Guide</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsbundleresourcerequest" class="URL">NSBundleResourceRequest</a>.</p></div></body></html>

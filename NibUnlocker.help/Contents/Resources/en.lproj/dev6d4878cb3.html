On iOS and tvOS, a live view is based on <code>UIView</code> or <code>UIViewController</code>, and on macOS it is based on <code>NSView</code> or <code>NSViewController</code>. The live view responds to user interaction and sends events to the responder chain. The view can contain user interface elements and is constructed in the same way as a view for the appropriate platform.</p></body></html>

Because the app won’t be distributed by Apple, assure users that you are a trusted developer by signing your app with a Developer ID certificate. Users gain additional assurance if your Developer ID-signed app is also <a href="dev08f90b3fe.html#dev08f90b3fe" class="xRef Aside">notarized</a> by Apple.</p><p>On macOS, if your app isn’t downloaded from the Mac App Store or signed with a Developer ID certificate, it won’t launch unless the user completely disables <a href="dev190d53ccb.html#dev190d53ccb" class="xRef Aside">Gatekeeper</a>. Users have the option of enabling or disabling <em>identified developers</em> in System Preferences.</p><p>Before distributing your app, thoroughly test the end-user experience of launching your app using a Gatekeeper-enabled Mac.</p><div id="dev007306e83" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Step 1: Enable hardened runtime</h2><p>First <a href="devf87a2ac8f.html#devf87a2ac8f" class="xRef AppleTopic">enable the hardened runtime capability</a> and optionally, disable some of its security protections if your app needs to perform some actions. You must enable <a href="dev9d65d791c.html#dev9d65d791c" class="xRef Aside">hardened runtime</a> for your app to be notarized by Apple.</p></div><div id="dev70216ce23" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Step 2: Archive your app</h2><p>Then <a href="dev91fe7130a.html#dev91fe7130a" class="xRef AppleTopic">prepare your app for distribution</a> and <a href="devf37a1db04.html#devf37a1db04" class="xRef AppleTopic">create an archive of your app</a>.

When you <a href="dev88332a81e.html#dev88332a81e" class="xRef AppleTopic">upload a macOS app to be notarized by Apple</a>, you’ll select Developer ID as the distribution method and it’ll be code signed with a Developer ID Application certificate. If you want to export a Developer ID-signed app without notarizing it, choose Export instead of Upload in the sheet that appears in this flow.</p><p>You can also upload Developer ID-signed disk images and installer packages using the <code>xcrun altool</code> command-line tool. (If you are running a beta version of Xcode, run <code>xcode-select —switch [path to Xcode]</code> first.)</p></div><div id="dev189ef8b72" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Step 4: Verify the signature and that the app launches correctly</h2><p><a href="dev1cc22a95c.html#dev1cc22a95c" class="xRef AppleTopic">Test that your notarized app or Developer ID-signed app</a> launches correctly on macOS when apps downloaded from identified developers is enabled.

A crash log contains a complete backtrace of the process at the time the app stopped. A crash log groups the stack frames by threads and the stack frame where the crash likely occurred is highlighted.</p><p>In both organizers, stack frames in your app are denoted with a person icon (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/co_DBGFrameUser.png" alt="" height="16" width="16">) </span>on the left and appear in black text. Stack frames in frameworks and system code are denoted with other unique icons and appear in gray text.</p><p>In the Energy organizer, reports are similar but show the percentage a frame appears in the total samples. An energy log contains a sampling of CPU usage taken over a period of time. You can navigate the backtraces in the historical tree structure to locate where your app is spending the most time.</p><div class="ListDescriptor"><p><strong class="Term">Change the name of a report: </strong>Place the insertion point in the header, then edit the text.</p></div><div class="ListDescriptor"><p><strong class="Term">Mark a report as resolved: </strong>Click the circle (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/DVTAnalyticsPoint_Unresolved.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>to the left of the report name in the header.</p></div><div class="ListDescriptor"><p><strong class="Term">Go to the source code for a stack frame: </strong>Hover the pointer over the stack frame, then click the arrow that appears. </p></div><div class="ListDescriptor"><p><strong class="Term">Go to the source code where the event occurred: </strong>Hover the pointer over the stack frame that is highlighted, then click the arrow that appears.</p><p>The Debug navigator opens to the stack frame that you hovered over. For a crash report, the backtrace for every thread is loaded into the Debug navigator and you can navigate the code similar to debugging a running app. For an energy report, the <a href="dev9b6f9a6bb.html#dev9b6f9a6bb" class="xRef Aside">heaviest backtrace</a>, that includes the stack frame you hovered over, is loaded.</p><div class="Alert"><p class="Important"><strong>Important: </strong>For best results, have the same project that you archived and distributed open in Xcode.

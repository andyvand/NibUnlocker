The shape, stroke type, and line color can tell you a lot about the current state of the constraint. Badges on lines show more information about the constraint relationship or indicate that the current value of the constant for the constraint is different from the expected value.</p><table data-type="Custom" aria-label="Canvas Lines and Badges"><thead><tr><th colspan="4" scope="col"><p class="TableHead">Line or Badge</p></th><th colspan="8" scope="col"><p class="TableHead">Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4"><p>I-bar</p></td><td colspan="8"><p>Lines with T-shaped end-caps-bars show the size of a space.

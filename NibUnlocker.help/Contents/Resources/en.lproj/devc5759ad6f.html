When you use Auto Layout constraints, the views in the user interface automatically resize and reposition themselves whenever the device configuration or language changes. For example, you can center an image horizontally in its superview. As the user rotates the iOS device, the image remains horizontally centered in both landscape and portrait orientations of the device. </p><p>Auto Layout is enabled by default.

You use Xcode to build apps for Apple products, including iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac. Xcode provides tools to manage your entire development workflow—from creating your app to testing, optimizing, and submitting it to the App Store.</p><p>A <em>project</em> keeps the necessary files and resources for developing your app organized. To create a project, start with one of the templates, then modify it however you like. Templates are available for each platform (iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS) and for common types of apps, frameworks, and libraries. Each template comes preconfigured with default settings and is ready to build and run.</p><figure><img src="Art/qs_choose_template.png" alt="" height="441" width="600"></figure><p>After you create a project, the <em>main window</em> appears. This window is your primary interface for viewing, editing, and managing all the parts of your project. It's flexible and configurable, adapting to the needs of the task at hand and allowing you to configure it to fit your work style.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_main_window.png" alt="" height="325" width="602"></figure><p>Use the <em>toolbar</em> to build and run your app, view the progress of running tasks, and configure your work environment. You’ll choose a run destination—for example, a simulator or device—from the Scheme menu. (If the toolbar is hidden, choose View &gt; Show Toolbar to show it.) Use the segmented control located on the right of the toolbar to show and hide the different areas of the main window.</p><figure><img src="Art/XC_O_Toolbar.png" alt="" height="67" width="600"></figure><p>Use the <em>navigator area</em> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/XC_O_area_button_navigator.png" alt="" height="10" width="13">) </span>for quick access to different parts of your project. Click a button in the <em>navigator bar</em> to show the corresponding parts in the <em>content area</em> below the navigator bar. For example, to view files in a project, click the <em>Project navigator</em> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/IDEStructureNavigatorTemplate.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>and the files appear in the content area.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_navigator_area.png" alt="" height="278" width="256"></figure><p>Select a file in the Project navigator to open it in the <em>editor area</em>. For example, if you select a source file, the file opens in the <em>source editor</em> and if you select a user interface file, the file opens in Interface Builder. <em>Interface Builder</em> is the visual design editor that’s integrated into Xcode. If no editor is available for a type of file, a Quick Look preview of the document appears in the editor area.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_editor_area.png" alt="" height="318" width="601"></figure><p>Select the project (the root file in the Project navigator) to open the <em>project editor</em>. Use this editor to view and edit your project and other settings. Use the tabs to switch between the different types of settings.</p><figure><img src="Art/pe_project_editor.png" alt="" height="309" width="601"></figure><p>Use the <em>inspector area</em> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/XC_O_utilities_button.png" alt="" height="10" width="13">) </span>to view and edit information for an object that you've selected in the navigator or editor area. To show an inspector, click the corresponding button in the <em>inspector bar</em>.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_utilities_area.png" alt="" height="449" width="296"></figure><p>To see descriptions of the symbols, interface objects, and build settings you select in the editor area, click the <em>Quick Help inspector</em> (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/UB_QuickHelp.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>in the inspector bar, or choose View &gt; Inspectors &gt; Show Quick Help Inspector. To view the full documentation for a symbol, click the Open in Developer Documentation link at the bottom of the Quick Help inspector.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_quickhelp.png" alt="" height="296" width="361"></figure><p>To use ready-made resources, select a library in the toolbar to open it. For example, select a user interface file in the project navigator, then select the Object library (<span class="NoBreak"><img src="Art/LB_Objects.png" alt="" height="8" width="8">) </span>to access user interface views and controls. Then drag the object you want from the library to the editor area in the main window.</p><figure><img src="Art/gs_library.png" alt="" height="281" width="600"></figure><div class="ListDescriptor"><p><strong class="Term">Next Step: </strong><a href="dev07db0e578.html#dev07db0e578" class="xRef AppleTopic">Create an Xcode project</a>.</p></div></body></html>

Indexing, code completion, refactoring, and other content-related tasks work seamlessly across a workspace.</p><p>Workspaces donâ€™t define targets or build behaviors; this information is defined at the project level. However, you can initiate a combined build of the products for the projects within a workspace. Xcode will detect implicit link dependencies between multiple targets in a workspace and build targets in the correct order.</p></body></html>

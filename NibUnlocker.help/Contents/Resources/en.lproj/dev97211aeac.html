A development or distribution certificate with its public key is stored in your developer account, but the certificate with its private key (called a <em>signing certificate</em>) should be in your keychain. Xcode will detect problems with your signing certificate but you can also use Keychain Access to <a href="dev97211aeac.html#devf945466d0" class="xRef Task">view a signing certificate</a> and if necessary, <a href="dev97211aeac.html#devc9fa33855" class="xRef Task">remove a signing certificate</a>.</p><div id="devf945466d0" class="Task"><h2 role="button" aria-controls="aria-devf945466d0" aria-expanded="true" class="Name">View a signing certificate in your keychain</h2><div class="TaskBody" role="region" aria-hidden="false" id="aria-devf945466d0"><ol><li><p>Launch Keychain Access (located in <code>/Applications/Utilities)</code>.</p><p>When you create a development or distribution certificate using Xcode, the certificate is automatically installed in your login keychain. </p></li><li><p>In the left pane, select login in the Keychains section and select Certificates (or My Certificates) in the Category section.</p><p>Only the signing certificates you created on this computer appear in the keychain. </p><div class="Alert"><p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>Your developer account will show all the certificates you created on all your Mac computers.

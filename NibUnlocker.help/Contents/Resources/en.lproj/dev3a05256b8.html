If needed, Xcode requests a certificate and adds a <a href="dev1c7c2c67d.html#dev1c7c2c67d" class="xRef Aside">signing certificate</a>, the certificate with its public-private key pair, to your keychain. The certificate with the public key is added to your <a href="devbbdb0a993.html#devbbdb0a993" class="xRef Aside">developer account</a>.</p><p>During the course of developing your app, you’ll create different <a href="dev80c6204ec.html#dev80c6204ec" class="xRef Aside">certificate types</a> for use in different contexts. You’ll use the same set of certificates for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps, and a different set of certificates for macOS apps. You’ll use <em>development certificates</em> to run your app on devices and use app services, and <em>distribution certificates</em> to distribute your app for testing and to upload it to <a href="devec4355ec5.html#devec4355ec5" class="xRef Aside">App Store Connect</a>.</p><p>Development certificates belong to individuals. You can create a total of two iOS development certificates and two Mac development certificates. In your developer account, the computer name is appended to the development certificate name (for example, <code>Gita Kumar (Work Mac)</code> where <code>Work Mac</code> is the computer name) so you can identify them.</p><p>In Xcode, <a href="dev8fbf65ad9.html#dev8fbf65ad9" class="xRef Aside">Accounts preferences</a> shows only the signing certificates on your Mac—the valid signing certificates in your keychain.</p><p>Distribution certificates belong to the team and are limited. For iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, three App Store and Ad Hoc distribution certificates are allowed per team. For macOS, three Mac App Store distribution certificates are allowed per team. For the Apple Developer Enterprise Program, two distribution certificates are allowed. Only the <a href="deva07f4f5b6.html#deva07f4f5b6" class="xRef Aside">Account Holder</a> or <a href="dev4587a5622.html#dev4587a5622" class="xRef Aside">Admin</a> role can create distribution certificates (if you’re enrolled as an individual, you are the <a href="deva07f4f5b6.html#deva07f4f5b6" class="xRef Aside">Account Holder</a>). </p><p>To share a signing certificate with another person on your team, <a href="dev154b28f09.html#dev154b28f09" class="xRef AppleTopic">export the signing certificate</a>, and on the other person’s Mac, double-click the exported file to install the signing certificate in the keychain.</p><p>If you use different Macs for development or belong to multiple teams, you may want to manage signing certificates yourself. You maintain signing certificates using either Accounts preferences in Xcode or Keychain Access. You can create and revoke certificates using either Xcode or your developer account. If you enroll as an organization, your <a href="dev4192b26ad.html#dev4192b26ad" class="xRef Aside">program role</a> determines what tasks you can perform using these tools.</p><div class="LinkUniversal"><strong>See also</strong><a href="devaf282080a.html#devaf282080a" class="xRef AppleTopic">Add your Apple ID account</a><a href="dev8a2822e0b.html#dev8a2822e0b" class="xRef AppleTopic">Export signing certificates and provisioning profiles</a><a href="dev154b28f09.html#dev154b28f09" class="xRef AppleTopic">Create, export, and delete signing certificates</a><a href="deva899b4fe5.html#deva899b4fe5" class="xRef AppleTopic">Download manual provisioning profiles</a><a href="devc4c7101d8.html#devc4c7101d8" class="xRef AppleTopic">If an intermediate certificate authority is missing</a><a href="dev97211aeac.html#dev97211aeac" class="xRef AppleTopic">View or remove a signing certificate in your keychain</a></div></body></html>

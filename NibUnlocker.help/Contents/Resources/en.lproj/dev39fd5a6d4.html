When a file is <em>locked</em>, you can move it to the Trash, but you can’t empty the Trash with the document in there. To edit the file, you must unlock it. Xcode can be set to automatically unlock files: Open Xcode &gt; Preferences &gt; General and select the “Automatically unlock files” checkbox.</p></body></html>

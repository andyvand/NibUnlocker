However, particles differ from sprites in two important ways:</p><ul><li><p>A particle’s texture is always stretched uniformly.</p></li><li><p>Particles are not represented by objects in the SpriteKit framework. This means you cannot perform node-related tasks on particles, nor can you associate physics bodies with particles to make them interact with other content. Although there is no visible class representing particles added by the emitter node, you can think of a particle as having properties like any other object.</p></li></ul><p>The properties associated with SpriteKit particles are entirely defined by the emitter node that created the particles. For each property value, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/skemitternode" class="URL">SKEmitterNode</a> class considers up to four factors:</p><ul><li><p>The average starting value.</p></li><li><p>A range for the values. Each time a new particle is emitted, a random value is calculated within that range.</p></li><li><p>The rate at which the value changes over time, also known as the property’s speed. Not all properties have a speed property.</p></li><li><p>An optional keyframe sequence.</p></li></ul></body></html>

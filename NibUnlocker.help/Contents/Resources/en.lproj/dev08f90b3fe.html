When you export a notarized app from Xcode, it code signs the app with a Developer ID certificate and <em>staples</em> a ticket from Apple to the app. The <em>ticket</em> confirms that you previously uploaded the app to Apple.</p><p>On macOS 10.14 and later, the user can launch notarized apps when Gatekeeper is enabled. When the user first launches a notarized app, Gatekeeper looks for the appâ€™s ticket online. If the user is offline, Gatekeeper looks for the ticket that was stapled to the app.</p></body></html>

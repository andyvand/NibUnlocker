A xib file (<code>.xib</code>) usually contains one view controller or menu bar. The contents of <code>.xib</code> and <code>.storyboard</code> files are stored in XML format. At build time, the <code>.xib</code> and <code>.storyboard</code> files are compiled into binary files called <code>nibs</code>. At runtime, nibs are loaded and the objects they contain are instantiated. </p></body></html>

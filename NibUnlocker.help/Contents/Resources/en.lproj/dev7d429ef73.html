If you choose Unit and UI tests when creating a project, the project includes targets for the main app and the test apps. A watchOS app has targets for the iOS app, WatchKit extension, and WatchKit app. macOS apps can have multiple targets too. Choose a target in the project editor to view and modify the targetâ€™s settings. Click the Add button (+) in the project editor to add a new Application, Framework &amp; Library, Test, or Application Extension target to your project.</p><p>Targets settings are edited in the following project editor panes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>General.</strong> Commonly edited target settings, such as the bundle identifier, version, and build number.

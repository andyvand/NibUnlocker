Later, you can release your app on the App Store or distribute it outside of the App Store.</p><p>You can <a href="dev88ff319e7.html#dev88ff319e7" class="xRef AppleTopic">add some capabilities</a> and run your app on devices using your personal Apple ID. However, to access all app services—for example, Apple Pay, Game Center, and In-App Purchase—and use the production environments, you need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" class="URL">join the Apple Developer Program</a>. You choose whether to join as an individual (a one person team) or an organization where you can invite other team members.</p><figure><img src="Art/pe_cap_add_capabilities.png" alt="" height="326" width="600"></figure><p>Regardless of the <a href="dev31de635e5.html#dev31de635e5" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribution method</a> you choose, follow <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design" class="URL">Human Interface Guidelines</a> and <a href="dev91fe7130a.html#dev91fe7130a" class="xRef AppleTopic">prepare your app for distribution</a>. For example, you should set the bundle ID, version number, and build string. If you want to release your app on the App Store, you must <a href="dev10510b1f7.html#dev8df242dec" class="xRef Task">add an app icon</a> and <a href="dev4b0ebb1bb.html#dev4b0ebb1bb" class="xRef AppleTopic">add an App Store icon</a>.</p><p>Initially, you can <a href="dev7ccaf4d3c.html#dev7ccaf4d3c" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute your app on registered devices (iOS, tvOS, watchOS)</a> and choose a method that uses either the development or production environments for app services. However, the number of devices you can register are limited and shared by your development team.</p><p>For macOS apps, you can <a href="dev295cc0fae.html#dev295cc0fae" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute to registered computers</a> using the development environments, or <a href="dev033e997ca.html#dev033e997ca" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute outside the Mac App Store</a> using the production environments but with limited app services. Optionally, <a href="dev88332a81e.html#dev88332a81e" class="xRef AppleTopic">upload your macOS app to be notarized</a> first so that users know your app comes from a trusted developer.</p><p>Alternatively, <a href="dev442d7f2ca.html#dev442d7f2ca" class="xRef AppleTopic">upload your app to App Store Connect</a> and <a href="dev2539d985f.html#dev2539d985f" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribute your app using TestFlight (iOS, tvOS, watchOS)</a>. You can invite internal testers (your App Store Connect users) and external testers (users with email addresses). Inviting external testers requires that you submit your app to <a href="devfc7555948.html#devfc7555948" class="xRef Aside">Beta App Review</a>. In App Store Connect, you then manage the builds, check status of testers, and collect feedback (go to <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devdc42b26b8" class="URL">TestFlight beta testing overview</a>).</p><figure><img src="Art/ao_upload_app.png" alt="" height="297" width="600"></figure><p>When you have your final build candidate, you can <a href="dev067853c94.html#dev067853c94" class="xRef AppleTopic">release it through the App Store</a> by submitting it to <a href="deva078a4380.html#deva078a4380" class="xRef Aside">App Review</a>. In App Store Connect, you enter required metadata and manage your releases (go to <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev34e9bbb5a" class="URL">Overview of publishing an app</a>). If you release an app, you are responsible for <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/devdf2cf83a9" class="URL">maintaining the app on the App Store</a>.</p><p>After you distribute your app using TestFlight or through the App Store, you can <a href="devc8ced2ea3.html#devc8ced2ea3" class="xRef AppleTopic">view crash and energy reports</a> in the organizer and jump to the source code where an event occurred.</p></body></html>

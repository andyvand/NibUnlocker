It’s designed to help you profile your macOS and iOS apps, processes, and devices in order to better understand and optimize their behavior and performance. Incorporating Instruments into your workflow from the beginning of the app development process can save you time later by helping you find issues early in the development cycle.</p><p>In Instruments, you use specialized tools, known as <em>instruments</em>, to trace different aspects of your apps, processes, and devices over time. Instruments collects data as it profiles, and presents the results to you in detail for analysis.</p><p>Unlike other performance and debugging tools, Instruments allows you to gather widely disparate types of data and view them side by side. This makes it easier to identify trends that might otherwise be overlooked. For example, your app may exhibit large memory growth caused by multiple open network connections. By using the Allocations and Connections instruments together, you can identify connections that are not closing and thus resulting in rapid memory growth.</p><p>By using Instruments effectively, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Examine the behavior of one or more apps or processes</p></li><li><p>Examine device-specific features, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</p></li><li><p>Perform profiling in a simulator or on a physical device</p></li><li><p>Create custom DTrace instruments to analyze aspects of system and app behavior</p></li><li><p>Track down problems in your source code</p></li><li><p>Conduct performance analysis on your app</p></li><li><p>Find memory problems in your app, such as leaks, abandoned memory, and zombies</p></li><li><p>Identify ways to optimize your app for greater power efficiency</p></li><li><p>Perform general system-level troubleshooting</p></li><li><p>Save instrument configurations as templates</p></li></ul><p>Although it’s embedded within and may be used with Xcode, Instruments is a separate app, which may be used independently as needed.</p><p>For detailed information about Instruments, see <a href="https://help.apple.com/instruments" class="URL">Instruments Help</a>.</p></body></html>

Stripping out the symbols can make apps significantly smaller.</p></div><div id="dev07263df8b" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">How much space does symbol stripping save?</h2><p>The amount of space you will save depends on a few factors. To find the size difference, build a distribution version of your app with and without the symbols stripped, install each of them on a device, and compare the size. You can build a distribution version for a <a href="dev7ccaf4d3c.html#dev7ccaf4d3c" class="xRef AppleTopic">registered device</a>, for <a href="dev23ea8b877.html#dev23ea8b877" class="xRef AppleTopic">manual distribution</a>, or for <a href="dev2539d985f.html#dev2539d985f" class="xRef AppleTopic">TestFlight</a>. Looking at the size of an archive build is not a reliable way to measure the size of an iOS, watchOS or tvOS app because the Swift standard libraries are only stripped as part of App Thinning.</p></div><div id="dev5f7cc58b6" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">How is Swift symbol stripping controlled?</h2><p>Symbol stripping for a build target is controlled using build settings. The default settings depend on the target. For example, the default is to strip all symbols for the main app executable, but not to strip all symbols for a framework. Three build settings control how Swift symbols are stripped:</p><ul><li><p><a href="itcaec37c2a6.html#dev5c0105d2a" class="xRef Subhead">Strip Linked Product (STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT)</a> strips symbols from the build.</p></li><li><p><a href="itcaec37c2a6.html#dev06ba8729b" class="xRef Subhead">Strip Style (STRIP_STYLE)</a> controls the level of symbol stripping.</p></li><li><p><a href="itcaec37c2a6.html#devd2ce4822a" class="xRef Subhead">Strip Swift Symbols (STRIP_SWIFT_SYMBOLS)</a> overrides the strip style to remove all Swift symbols from the main app executable and from any bundled frameworks. This setting can make a significant difference for framework targets.</p></li></ul></div><div id="dev1d831f533" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">How do I strip the Swift standard library symbols?</h2><p>The build settings donâ€™t strip symbols from the Swift standard library as it is not built with your project. Set the Strip Swift symbols <a href="devde46df08a.html#devde46df08a" class="xRef AppleTopic">distribution option</a> for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps to strip the standard library symbols as part of App Thinning.</p></div><div id="deve7c597d79" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Is there a way to see the symbols after stripping?</h2><p>Sometimes you may want to see the symbols for a framework that was previously stripped, such as when debugging a link failure. Because the linker uses a separate data structure to look up symbols in a framework, you can use the <code>dyldinfo</code> subcommand of the <code>xcrun</code> command-line tool to export the symbols by running <code>xcrun dyldinfo -export</code> in the terminal.</p></div><div id="devc15996fb4" class="Subhead"><h2 class="Name">Why would I turn symbol stripping off?</h2><p>Symbols stripped during the build process can be saved to a dSYM file which Xcode can use to read the symbols at a later date. There are a few cases when the dSYM file is not sufficient. In addition, there is no dSYM file for the Swift standard library. The cases include:</p><ul><li><p>Enterprise apps in the QA cycle when the symbols from the Swift standard library are needed for crash logs.</p></li><li><p>Distribution of the app without using the AppStore or TestFlight.</p></li><li><p>Using some third-party crash logging tools.</p></li><li><p>Using the <code>dladdr</code> system function for in-process crash symbolication.</p></li></ul><p>Most of the time you can reenable symbol stripping for your final app.</p></div><div class="LinkUniversal"><strong>See also</strong><a href="dev04b3a04ba.html#dev04b3a04ba" class="xRef AppleTopic">Configure build settings</a></div></body></html>
